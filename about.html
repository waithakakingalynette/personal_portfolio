            Nature is beautiful and a good place to relax your mind.
            I feel good every time I see green sorrounding our country.
            I was grew up soprrounded by very conservative parents.
            All I grew up knowing is that nature punishes you if you
            do not take care of it.I did not understand when I was a 
            child but after growing up,I understood after seeing
            for some ting that all our country would talk is hunger
            striking our country in parts that have not experienced
            before.In simple terms,I believe that most of the problems
            faced nowadays are caused by our irresponsibility.I love a
            clean environment and to me means that 
            "A clean environment A healthy life".No diseases no hunger.
            That is what I love advocating for.
